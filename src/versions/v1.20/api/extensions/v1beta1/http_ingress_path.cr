    # PathType determines the interpretation of the Path matching. PathType can be one of the following values: * Exact: Matches the URL path exactly. * Prefix: Matches based on a URL path prefix split by '/'. Matching is
    #   done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers is the
    #   list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a
    #   match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the
    #   request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring
    #   of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. [/foo/bar](/foo/bar)
    #   matches [/foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz).](/foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz).)
    # * ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of the Path matching is up to
    #   the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType
    #   or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types.
    # Implementations are required to support all path types. Defaults to ImplementationSpecific.
